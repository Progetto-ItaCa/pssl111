The 111th Peripatetic Seminar on Sheaves and Logic (PSSL 111) will take place on Sep 4th and Sep 5th 2025 in Bologna, Italy.

Note that the dates are not on a weekend, but on a Thursday and Friday, unlike the usual PSSL tradition.
Since it is outside term time, we expect it will not be a problem for most participants.
