Note that the dates are not on a weekend, but on a Thursday and Friday, unlike the usual PSSL tradition.
Since it is outside term time, we expect it will not be a problem for most participants.

  is a long-running series of informal gatherings covering all aspects of category theory and its applications, typically held over a weekend at a university in Europe.
  The first PSSL was held in Oxford, in May 1976. This is the 111th PSSL, following meetings in Tallinn, Leiden, Terrasini, and Athens.
