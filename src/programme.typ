      In the framework of ideally exact categories, we introduce a notion of coherent and of ideal action that generalize different aspects of unital actions of rings and algebras.

    title: "Lexicographic sums and splayed categories",
    abstract: [
      Categories may be presented in several ways: the two most popular presentations involve (1) a set of objects and, for each pair of objects x and y, a set of morphisms C(x, y) from x to y; (2) a set of objects and a set of morphisms. These presentations lend themselves to different generalisations of categories: the former to enriched categories, and the latter to internal categories. In this talk, I will consider a third presentation of category involving (3) a set of objects and, for each object x, a set C[x] of morphisms from x. We show that this presentation lends itself to a new generalisation of category, which we call a splayed category. While enriched categories may be defined with respect to monoidal categories, and internal categories with respect to categories with pullbacks, splayed categories may be defined with respect to any category with lexicographic sums.

    title: "A topos for extended Weihrauch degrees",
    abstract: [
      Weihrauch reducibility is a notion of reducibility between computational problems that is useful to calibrate the uniform computational strength of a multi-valued function. It complements the analysis of mathematical theorems done in reverse mathematics, as multi-valued functions on represented spaces can be considered as realizers of theorems in a natural way. Despite the rich literature and the relevance of the applications of category theory in logic and realizability, actually there are just a few works starting to study the Weihrauch reducibility from a categorical point of view. The main purpose of this talk is to provide a full categorical account to the notion of extended Weihrauch reducibility
      introduced by A. Bauer, which generalizes the original notion of Weihrauch reducibility. In particular, we present a tripos and a topos for extended Weihrauch degrees. We start by defining a new tripos, abstracting the notion of extended Weihrauch degrees, and then we apply the tripos-to-topos construction to obtain the desired topos. Then we show that the Kleene-Vesley topos is a topos of j-sheaves for a certain Lawvere-Tierney topology over the topos of extended Weihrauch degrees.

      This talk is based on joint work with Samuele Maschio.
